<h2><a name="A_GOOD_SAMARITAN" id="A_GOOD_SAMARITAN"></a>A GOOD SAMARITAN</h2>


<p>The little District Telegraph boy, with a dirty
face, stood at the edge of the desk, and, rubbing
his sleeve across his cheek, made it unnecessarily
dirtier.</p>

<p>"Answer, sir?"</p>

<p>"No&mdash;yes&mdash;wait a minute." Reed tore
the yellow envelope and spread the telegram.
It read:</p>

<p>"Do I meet you at your office or at Martin's
and what time?"</p>

<p>"The devil!" Reed commented, and the
boy blinked indifferently. He was used to
stronger. "The casual Rex all over! Yes,
boy, there's an answer." He scribbled rapidly,
and the two lines of writing said this:</p>

<p>"Waiting for you at office now. Hurry up.
C. Reed."</p>

<p>He fumbled in his pocket and gave the
youngster a coin. "See that it's sent instantly&mdash;<a name='Page_4' id='Page_4'><span class="pagenum">Page 4</span></a>like
lightning. Run!" and the sharp little
son of New York was off before the last word
was well out.</p>

<p>Half an hour later, to Reed waiting at his
office in Broadway impatiently, there strolled
in a good-looking and leisurely young man
with black clothes on his back and peace and
good-will on his face. "Hope I haven't kept
you waiting, Carty," he remarked in friendly
tones. "Plenty of time, isn't there?"</p>

<p>"No, there isn't," his cousin answered, and
there was a touch of snap in the accent.
"Really, Rex, you ought to grow up and be
responsible. It was distinctly arranged that
you should call here for me at six, and now
it's a quarter before seven."</p>

<p>"Couldn't remember the hour or the place
to save my life," the younger man asserted
earnestly. "I'm just as sorry as I can be,
Carty. You see I did remember we were to
dine at Martin's. So much I got all right&mdash;and
that was something, wasn't it, Carty?"
he inquired with an air of wistful pride, and
<a name='Page_5' id='Page_5'><span class="pagenum">Page 5</span></a>the frown on the face of the other dissolved
in laughter.</p>

<p>"Rex, there's no making you over&mdash;worse
luck. Come along. I've got to go home to
dress after dinner you see, before we make our
call. You'll do, on the strength of being a
theological student."</p>

<p>The situation was this: Reginald Fairfax,
in his last year at the Theological Seminary,
in this month of May, and lately ordained, had
been seriously spoken of as assistant to the
Rector of the great church of St. Eric's. It
was a remarkable position to come the way of
an undergraduate, and his brilliant record at
the seminary was one of the two things which
made it possible. The other was the friendship
and interest of his cousin, Carter Reed,
head clerk in the law firm of Rush, Walden,
Lee and Lee, whose leading member, Judge
Rush, was also senior warden at St. Eric's.
Reed had called Judge Rush's attention to
his young cousin's career, and, after some inquiry,
the vestryman had asked that the
<a name='Page_6' id='Page_6'><span class="pagenum">Page 6</span></a>young man should be brought to see him, to
discuss certain questions bearing on the work.
It was almost equivalent to a call coming from
such a man, and Reed was delighted; but
here his troubles began. In vain did he hopefully
fix date after date with the slippery Rex&mdash;something
always interfered. Twice, to
his knowledge, it had been the chance of seeing
a girl from Orange which had thrown over
the chance of seeing the man of influence and
power. Once the evening had been definitely
arranged with Judge Rush himself, and Reed
was obliged to go alone and report that the
candidate had disappeared into a tenement
district and no one knew where to find him.
The effect of that was fortunately good&mdash;Judge
Rush was rather pleased than otherwise
that a young clergyman should be so taken
up with his work as to forget his interests.
But Reed was most anxious that this evening's
appointment should go off successfully,
while Rex was as light-hearted as a
bird. Any one would have thought it was
<a name='Page_7' id='Page_7'><span class="pagenum">Page 7</span></a>Reed's own future he was laboring over instead
of that of the youngster who had a gift
of making men care for him and work for him
without effort on his own part.</p>

<p>The two walked down Broadway toward
the elevated road, Rex's dark eyes gathering
amusement here and there in the crowded
way as they went.</p>

<p>"Look at Billy Strong&mdash;why there's Billy
Strong across the street. Come over and
I'll present you, Carty. Just the chap you
want to meet. He's a great athlete&mdash;on the
water-polo team of the New York Athletic
Club, you know&mdash;as much of an old sport
as you are." And Reed found himself swung
across and standing before a powerful, big
figure of a man, almost before he could answer.
There was another man with the distinguished
Billy, and Reed had not regarded the two for
more than one second before he discovered
that they were both in a distinct state of intoxication.
In fact, Strong proclaimed the
truth at once, false shame cast to the winds.
<a name='Page_8' id='Page_8'><span class="pagenum">Page 8</span></a>He threw his arm about Rex's neck with a
force of affection which almost knocked down
the quartette.</p>

<p class="figcenter"><a name="p02" id="p02"></a><a href="./images/p02.png"><img  src="./images/tp02.png" alt="&quot;Recky,&quot; he bubbled, &quot;good old Recky&mdash;bes' fren' ev' had&quot;" title="&quot;Recky,&quot; he bubbled, &quot;good old Recky&mdash;bes' fren' ev' had&quot;" /></a></p><p class="figcenter"><i>"Recky," he bubbled, "good old Recky&mdash;bes' fren' ev' had"</i></p>

<p>"Recky," he bubbled, "good old Recky&mdash;bes'
fren' ev' had&mdash;I'm drunk, Recky&mdash;too
bad. We're both drunk. Take's home."
Rex glanced at his cousin in dismay, and
Strong repeated his invitation cordially.
"Take's home, Recky," he insisted, with the
easy air of a man who confers an honor. "'S up
to you, Recky."</p>

<p>Rex looked at his frowning cousin doubtfully,
pleadingly.</p>

<p>"It almost seems as if it was, doesn't it,
Carty?" he said. "We can't leave them like
this."</p>

<p>"I don't see why we can't&mdash;I can," Reed
asserted. "It's none of our business, Rex,
and we really haven't time to palaver. Come
along."</p>

<p>The gentle soul of Rex Fairfax was surprisingly
firm. "Carty, they'd be arrested
in five minutes," he reasoned. "It's a wonder
<a name='Page_9' id='Page_9'><span class="pagenum">Page 9</span></a>they haven't been already. And Billy's
people&mdash;it would break their hearts. I
know some of them well, you see. I was
with him only last week over in Orange."</p>

<p>"Oh!" Reed groaned. "That Girl from
Orange again." He opened his lips once
more to launch nervous English against this
quixotism, but Strong interposed.</p>

<p>"'S all true," he solemnly stated, fixing
his eyes rollingly on Reed. "Got Orange-colored
cousin what break Recky's heart
if don't take's home. Y'see&mdash;y'see&mdash;"
The President of these United States in a
cabinet council would have stopped to listen
to him, so freighted with great facts coming
was his confidential manner. "Y'see&mdash;wouldn't
tell ev'body&mdash;only you," and he
laid a mighty hand on Reed's shoulder. "I'm
so drunk. Awful pity&mdash;too bad," and he
sighed deeply. "Now, Recky, ol' man, take's
home."</p>

<p class="figcenter"><a name="p03" id="p03"></a><a href="./images/p03.png"><img  src="./images/tp03.png" alt="&quot;Who's your friend, Billy?&quot;" title="&quot;Who's your friend, Billy?&quot;" /></a></p><p class="figcenter"><i>"Who's your friend, Billy?"</i></p>

<p>"Who's your friend, Billy?" Rex inquired,
disregarding this appeal.</p>
<p><a name='Page_10' id='Page_10'><span class="pagenum">Page 10</span></a></p>
<p>Billy burst into a shout of laughter which
Fairfax promptly clipped by putting his
hand over the big man's mouth. "He's
bes' joke yet," Strong remarked through
Rex's fingers. "He's go'n' kill himself,"
and he kissed the restraining hand gallantly.</p>

<p>The two sober citizens turned and stared
at the gentlemen. He looked it. He looked
as if there could be no step deeper into the
gloom which enveloped him, except suicide.
He nodded darkly as the two regarded him.</p>

<p>"Uh-huh. Life's failure. Lost cuff-button.
Won't live to be indecent. Go'n' kill m'self
soon's this dizhiness goesh pasht. Billy's
drunk, but I'm subject to&mdash;to dizhiness."</p>

<p>Rex turned to his cousin with a gesture.
"You see, Carty, we can't leave them. I'm
just as disappointed as you are, but it would
be a beastly thing to do, to let them get pulled
in as common drunks. What's your friend's
name?" he demanded again of Strong.</p>

<p>"Got lovely name," he averred eagerly.
"Good ol' moth-eaten name. Name's Schuyler
<a name='Page_11' id='Page_11'><span class="pagenum">Page 11</span></a>VanCourtlandt Van de Water&mdash;ain't it
Schuylie&mdash;ain't that your name&mdash;or's that
mine? I&mdash;I f'rget lil' things," he said in an
explanatory manner.</p>

<p>But the suicide spoke up for himself.
"Tha's my name," he said aggressively.
"Knew it in a minute. Tha's my father's
name and my grandfath's name, and
my great grandfath's name and my great-great&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Stop," said Rex tersely, and the man
stopped. "Now tell me where you live."</p>

<p>Billy Strong leaned over and punched the
man in the ribs. "You lemme tell 'em. Lives
nine-thous-n sixt'-four East West Street," he
addressed Rex, and chuckled.</p>

<p>"Don't be a donkey, Billy&mdash;tell me his
right address." Rex spoke with annoyance&mdash;this
scene was getting tiresome, and although
Reed was laughing hopelessly, he was
on his mind.</p>

<p>"Oh! F'got!" Billy's tipsy coyness was
elephantine. "Lives <i>six</i> thous'n <i>sev</i>'nty four
<a name='Page_12' id='Page_12'><span class="pagenum">Page 12</span></a>North S&mdash;South Street," and he roared with
laughter.</p>

<p>Rex was about to learn how to manage
Billy Strong. "Bill," he said, "be decent.
You're making me lots of trouble," and Billy
burst into tears and sobbed out:</p>

<p>"Wouldn' make Recky trouble for worlds&mdash;good
ol' Recky&mdash;half-witted ol' goat, but
bes' fren' ev' had," and the address was captured.</p>

<p>Rex turned to his cousin, his winning, deprecating
manner warning Reed but softening
him against his will. "Carty," he said,
"there's nothing for it, but for you to take
one chap and I the other and see 'em home.
It's only a little after seven and we ought to
be able to meet by half-past eight&mdash;at the
Hotel Netherland, say&mdash;that's near the
Rush's. We'll have to give up dinner, but
we'll get a sandwich somewhere, and we'll
do. I'll take Strong because he's more troublesome&mdash;I
think I can manage him. It's
awfully good of you, and I can tell you
<a name='Page_13' id='Page_13'><span class="pagenum">Page 13</span></a>I appreciate it. But it wouldn't be civilized
to do less, old Carty, would it?"
And Reed found himself, grumbling but
docile, linked to the suicide's arm, and
guiding his shuffling foot-steps in the way
they should go.</p>

<p>"Now, we'll both kill ourselves, old Carty,
won't we?" Rex heard his cousin's charge
mumble cheerfully as they started off, with a
visible lengthening of his gloom at the thought
of companionship at death.</p>

<p>Strong was marching along with an unearthly
decorum that should have made Fairfax
suspicious. But instead it cheered his
optimistic soul immensely. "Good for you
old man," he said encouragingly. "At this
rate we'll get you home in no time." And
Billy, at that second, thrust out his great shoulder
into the crowd, and almost knocked a man
down. The man, whirled sidewise in front of
them, glared savagely.</p>

<p>"What do you mean by that?" he demanded.
Strong, to whom nothing would
<a name='Page_14' id='Page_14'><span class="pagenum">Page 14</span></a>have given more joy than a tussle, bent down
and peered into the other's face.</p>

<p>"Is it a man or a monkey?" he piped, and
shrieked with laughter.</p>

<p>The man's strained temper broke suddenly
and Rex caught him by the arm as he was
about to spring for Strong, and promptly threw
himself between the two.</p>

<p>"Look here, Billy," he remonstrated, "if
you fight anybody it's got to be me," and he
spoke over his shoulder to the stranger. "You
see what I'm up against. I'm getting him
home&mdash;do just go on," and the man went.</p>

<p>But Billy's head was in his guardian's neck
and he was spluttering and sobbing. "Fight
you? Nev'&mdash;s' help me&mdash;nev'&mdash;Fight poor,
ole fool Recky&mdash;bes' fren' ev' had? No sir.
I wouldn' fight you Recky," and he raised a
tear-stained face and gazed mournfully into
his eyes. "D'ye think I'd&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, shut up!" Rex ejaculated, "and hold
your head up, Billy. You make me sick."</p>

<p>The intoxicated heavy freight being under
<a name='Page_15' id='Page_15'><span class="pagenum">Page 15</span></a>way again, Rex looked about for the rest of
the train, but in vain. After a halt of a minute
or so he decided that they were lost and
would have to stay lost, the situation being
too precarious, in this land of policemen,
with one hundred and ninety pounds of noisy
uncertainty on his hands, to risk any unnecessary
movement. Billy kept every breath
of time alive and varied. Within two minutes
of the first adventure he managed to put
his elbow clearly and forcibly into a small man's
mouth, and before the other could resent it:</p>

<p>"'S my elbow, sir," he said, haughtily,
stopping and staring down.</p>

<p>"Well, why in thunder don't you keep it
where it belongs?" snapped the man, and
Billy caught him by the sleeve.</p>

<p>"Lil' sir," he said impressively, "if you
should bite off my elbow, you saucy baggage"&mdash;and
the thought was too much for him.
Tears filling his eyes he turned to Rex. "Recky,
you spank that lil' sir," he pleaded brokenly.
"He's too lil' for me&mdash;I'd hurt him"&mdash;<a name='Page_16' id='Page_16'><span class="pagenum">Page 16</span></a>and
Rex meditated again. A shock came
when they reached the corner of Broadway
and Chambers Street. "Up's' daisy," crowed
Billy Strong, and swung Fairfax facing uptown
with a mighty heave.</p>

<p>"The Elevated station's down a block, old
chap," explained the sober contingent. "We
have to take the Elevated to Seventy-second
you know, and walk across to your place."</p>

<p>Billy looked at him pityingly. "You poor
lil' pup," he crooned. "Didn' I keep tellin'
you had to go Chris'pher Street ferry meet a
girl? Goin' theater with girl." He tipped
his derby one-sided and started off on a cakewalk.</p>

<p>Rex had to march beside him willy-nilly.
"Look here, Billy," he reasoned, exasperated
at this entirely fresh twist in the corkscrew
business of getting Strong home. "Look
here, Billy, this is tommy-rot. You haven't
any date with a girl, and if you had you couldn't
keep it. Come along home, man; that's
the place for you."</p>
<p><a name='Page_17' id='Page_17'><span class="pagenum">Page 17</span></a></p>
<p>But Billy was suddenly a Gibraltar of firmness.
"Got date with lovely blue-eyed girlie&mdash;couldn't
dish'point her. Unmanly deed&mdash;Recky, d' <i>you</i> want bes' fren' ev' had to do
unmanly deed, and dish'point trustin' female?
Nev', Recky&mdash;nev', ol' man. Lesh be true to
th' ladies till hell runs dry&mdash;Oh, 'scuse me
Recky&mdash;f'got you was parson&mdash;till <i>well</i>
runs dry, meant say. That all right? Come on
t' Chris'pher Street." And in spite of desperate
attempts, of long argument and appeal on
Rex's part, to Christopher Street they went.</p>

<p>The ministering angel had no hankering to
risk his charge in a street-car, so, as the distance
was not great, they walked.</p>

<p>Fairfax's dread was that, having saved his
friend so far, he should attract the attention
of a policeman and be arrested. So he kept
a sharp lookout for bluecoats and passed them
studiously on the other side. What was his
horror therefore, turning a corner, to turn
squarely into the majestic arm of the law, and
what was his greater horror, to hear Billy Strong
<a name='Page_18' id='Page_18'><span class="pagenum">Page 18</span></a>suavely address him. Billy lifted his hat to the
large, fat officer as he might have lifted it to
his sweetheart in her box at the Horse Show.</p>

<p>"Would you have the g&mdash;goodness to tell
me," he inquired, with distinguished courtesy,
"if this is"&mdash;Billy's articulation was improving,
but otherwise he was just as tipsy as ever&mdash;"if
this is&mdash;Chris-to-pher Street&mdash;or&mdash;or
Wednesday?"</p>

<p>"Hey?" inquired the policeman, and stared.
Repartee seemed not to be his forte.</p>

<p class="figcenter">
<i>"Thank you&mdash;thank you very much&mdash;very, very much&mdash;old rhinoceros"</i></p>

<p>"Thank you&mdash;thank you very much"&mdash;Billy's
gratitude spilled over conventional
limits&mdash;"very, <i>very</i> much&mdash;old rhinoceros,"
he finished, and shot suddenly ahead, dragging
Rex with him into the whirlpool of a
moving crowd, and it dawned on the policeman
five minutes later that the courtly gentleman
was drunk.</p>

<p>The anxiety of this game was its unexpectedness.
Strong, in the turn of a hand grew
playful, after the fashion of a mammoth kitten.
He bounded this way and that, knocking into
<a name='Page_19' id='Page_19'><span class="pagenum">Page 19</span></a>somebody inevitably at every leap, and at each
contact he wheeled toward the injured and lifted
his hat and bowed low and brought out "I&mdash;beg&mdash;your&mdash;pardon"
with a drawl of
sarcastic emphasis too insulting to be described.</p>

<p>"Billy," pleaded Rex, taking to pathos,
"don't do that again. You'll get arrested, and
maybe they'll arrest me too, and you don't
want to get me into a hole, do you?"</p>

<p>Billy stopped short with a suddenness which
came near to upsetting his guide, and put both
large hands on Rex's shoulders, and gazed into
his eyes with a world of blurred affection.
"Reck, ol'fel'," and his voice broke with a
sob, "if I got you into hole, I'd jump in hole
after you, and I'd&mdash;and I'd&mdash;pull hole in
after both of us, and then I'd&mdash;I'd tell hole
you was bes' fren' ev' had, and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Come along and behave," cut in the victim
of this devotion shortly. "Don't be a fool."</p>

<p>Strong lifted a fatherly forefinger. "Naughty
naughty! Shouldn' call brother fool. Danger
<a name='Page_20' id='Page_20'><span class="pagenum">Page 20</span></a>hell fire if you call brother fool. Nev' min',
Recky&mdash;we un'stand each other. Two fools.
I'm go'n behave." He knocked his derby in the
back so it rested on his nose, stuck his chin up
to meet it, and started off in the most unmistakable
semblance of a tipsy man to be met
anywhere. "See me behavin'?" he remarked
sidewise, with a gleam of rollicking deviltry
out of his eyes.</p>

<p class="figcenter"><a name="p05" id="p05"></a><a href="./images/p05.png"><img  src="./images/tp05.png" alt="&quot;So tired&quot; he remarked. &quot;Go'n have good nap now&quot;" title="&quot;So tired&quot; he remarked. &quot;Go'n have good nap now&quot;" /></a></p><p class="figcenter"><i>"So tired" he remarked. "Go'n have good nap now"</i></p>

<p>Christopher Street ferry was reached safely
by a miracle, and inside the ferry-house
Strong made a bee line for a truck and threw
his great body full length upon it with a loud
yawn of joy. "So tired," he remarked. "Go'n
have good nap now," and he closed his eyes
peacefully.</p>

<p>"See here, Billy, this won't do. You said you
had to meet a girl&mdash;what about that?"</p>

<p>"Oh, tha's all right," Billy agreed easily.
"You meet girl&mdash;tell her you got me drunk,"
and he turned over and prepared for slumber.
Strenuous argument was necessary to rouse
him even to half a sense of responsibility.
<a name='Page_21' id='Page_21'><span class="pagenum">Page 21</span></a>"Recky, dear, you&mdash;'noy me," he said with
severity, coming to a sitting position and contemplating
Rex with mild displeasure. "What
kin' girl? Why, jes' girly-girl. Lovely blue-eyed
girly-girl&mdash;kind of girl&mdash;colored hair,"&mdash;he
swept his hand descriptively over his own
black locks. "Wears sort of&mdash;skirts, you
know&mdash;you 'member the kind. All of 'em
same thing&mdash;well, she wears 'em too. Tha's
all," and he dropped heavily back to the truck
and retired into his coat collar.</p>

<p>Rex shook him. "That won't do, Billy. I
can't pick out a girl on that. Will there be a
chaperone with her?"</p>

<p>"No!" thundered Billy.</p>

<p>"How is a girl allowed to go to the theater
with you without a chaperone?" inquired Rex
incredulously. "This is New York."</p>

<p>Strong brought down his fist. "Death to
chaperones! <i>A bas les chaperones!</i> Don't you
think girl's mother trust her to me? Look at
me! I'll be chaperone to tha' girl, and father,
'n' mother, 'n' a few uncles and aunts." He
<a name='Page_22' id='Page_22'><span class="pagenum">Page 22</span></a>threw his arm out with a gesture which comprised
the universe. "I'll be all the world to
tha' girl. You go meet her 'n' tell her you got
me drunk," he concluded with a radiant smile.</p>

<p>Rex considered. There seemed to be enough
method in Strong's madness to justify the belief
that he had an engagement. If so, he must
by all means wait and trust to luck to pick out
the "lovely blue-eyed girlie" who was the
"party of the other part," and hope for an inspiration
as to what to tell her. She might be
with or without a chaperone, she might be any
variety of the species, but Strong seemed to be
quite clear that she had blue eyes.</p>

<p>The crowd from the incoming boat began
to unload into the ferry-house, and Rex placed
himself anxiously by the entrance. Three or
four thin men scurried in advance, then a
bunch of stout and middle-aged persons straggled
along puffing. Then came a set of young
people in theater array, chattering and laughing
as they hurried, and another set, and another&mdash;the
main body of the little army was
<a name='Page_23' id='Page_23'><span class="pagenum">Page 23</span></a>upon him. Rex scanned them for a girl alone
or a girl with her mother. Ah! here she was&mdash;this
must be Strong's "blue-eyed girlie." She
was alone and pretty, a little under-bred and
blond. Rex lifted his hat.</p>

<p>"I beg your pardon," he said, in his most
winning way; "are you waiting for Mr.
Strong?"</p>

<p>The girl threw up her head and looked
frightened, and then angry.</p>

<p>"No, I am not," she said, and then, with a
haughty look, "I call you pretty saucy," and
Rex was left mortified and silent, while a passing
man murmured, "Served you right," and a
woman laughed scornfully. He stalked across
to the tranquil form on the truck.</p>

<p>"Billy," he said, and shook a massive shoulder.
"Wake up. Tell me that girl's name."</p>

<p>Strong opened his eyes like a baby waked
from dewy sleep. "Wha's that, Recky&mdash;dear
old Recky&mdash;bes' fren'&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Cut that out," said Rex, sharply. "Tell
me the name of the girl you're waiting here to
<a name='Page_24' id='Page_24'><span class="pagenum">Page 24</span></a>meet," and he laughed a short bitter laugh.
The girl whom "Billy" was waiting to meet!
Rex was getting tired and hungry.</p>

<p>Strong smiled a gentle, obstinate, tipsy smile
and shook his head. "No, Recky, dear ol'
fren'&mdash;bes' fren'&mdash;well, nev' min'. Can't
tell girl's name; tha's her secret."</p>

<p>"Don't be an ass, Billy&mdash;quick, now, tell
me the name."</p>

<p>"Naughty, naughty!" quoted Billy again,
and waggled his forefinger. "Danger hell fire!
Couldn' tell girl's name, Recky&mdash;be dishon'able.
Couldn', no, couldn'. Anythin' else&mdash;ask
m' anythin' else in all these wide worlds"&mdash;and
he struck his breast with fervor. "Tell
you <i>anythin'</i>, Recky, but couldn' betray trustin'
girl's secret."</p>

<p>"Billy, can't you give me an idea what the
girl's like?" pleaded Rex desperately. Billy
smiled up at him drowsily. "Perfectly good
girl," he elucidated. "Good eyes, good wind,
kind to mother&mdash;perfectly good girl in ev&mdash;every
r-respect," he concluded, emphasizing
<a name='Page_25' id='Page_25'><span class="pagenum">Page 25</span></a>his sentences by articulating them. He dropped
his chin into his chest with a recumbent bow,
and his arm described an impressive semicircle.
"Present to her 'surances my most disting'shed
consider-ration&mdash;soon's you find her,"
and he went flop on his side and was asleep.</p>

<p>Rex had to give it up. He heard the gates
rattling open for the next boat-load, and took
his stand again, bracing himself for another
rebuff. The usual vanguard, the usual quicksilver
bunch of humanity, massing, separating,
flowing this way and that, and in the midst of
them a fair-haired, timid-looking young girl,
walking quietly with down-cast eyes, as if unused
to being in big New York alone at eight
o'clock at night. Rex stood in front of her with
bared head.</p>

<p>"I beg your pardon," he repeated his formula;
"are you looking for Mr. Strong?"</p>

<p>The startled eyes lifted to his a short second,
then dropped again. "No, for Mr. Week," she
answered softly, and unconscious of witticism,
melted into the throng.</p>
<p><a name='Page_26' id='Page_26'><span class="pagenum">Page 26</span></a></p>
<p>This was a heavy boat-load, for it was just
theater time&mdash;they were still coming. And
suddenly his heart bounded and stopped. Of
course&mdash;he was utterly foolish not to have
known&mdash;it was she&mdash;Billy Strong's bewitching
cousin, the girl from Orange. There
she stood with her big, brown eyes searching,
gazing here and there, as lovely, as incongruous
as a wood-nymph strayed into a political meeting.
The feather of her hat tossed in the May
breeze; the fading light from the window behind
her shone through loose hair about her
face, turned it into a soft dark aureole; the
gray of her tailor gown was crisp and fresh as
spring-time. To Rex's eyes no picture had ever
been more satisfying.</p>

<p>Suddenly she caught sight of him, and her
face lighted as if lamps had shone out of a twilight,
and in a second he had her hand in his,
and was talking away, with responsibility and
worry, and that heavy weight on the truck
back there, quite gone out of the world. She
was in it, and himself&mdash;the world was full.
<a name='Page_27' id='Page_27'><span class="pagenum">Page 27</span></a>The girl seemed to be as oblivious of outside
facts, as he, for it was quite two minutes, and
the last straggler from the boat had disappeared
into the street before she broke into one of
his sentences.</p>

<p>"Why, but&mdash;I forgot. You made me forget
entirely, Mr. Fairfax. I'm going to the theater
with my cousin, Billy Strong. He ought to be
here&mdash;where is he?"</p>

<p>Rex shivered lest her roving eyes might
answer the question, for Billy's truck with
Billy slumbering peacefully on it, lay in full
view not fifty feet away. But her gaze passed
unsuspiciously over the prostrate, huddled
form.</p>

<p>"It's very queer&mdash;I'm sure this was the
right boat." She looked up at his face anxiously,
and he almost moaned aloud. What was he
going to say to her?</p>

<p>"That's what I'm here for, Miss Margery&mdash;to
explain about Billy. He&mdash;he isn't feeling
at all himself to-night, and it's utterly impossible
for him to go with you." To his as<a name='Page_28' id='Page_28'><span class="pagenum">Page 28</span></a>tonishment
her face broke into a very satisfied
smile. "Oh&mdash;well, I'm sorry Billy's ill, but
we'll hope for the best, and I won't really object
to you as a substitute, you know. Of course
it's improper, and mother wouldn't think of
letting me go with you&mdash;but I'm going. Mother
won't mind when I tell her it's done. I've
never been alone with a man to anything, except
with my cousin&mdash;it's like stealing watermelons,
isn't it? Don't you think it's rather
fun?"</p>

<p>Staggered by the situation, Fairfax thought
desperately and murmured something which
sounded like "Oochee-Goochee," as he tried
to recall it later. The girl's gay voice went on:
"It would be wicked to waste the tickets. City
people aren't going to the theater as late as this,
so we won't see any one we know. I think it's a
dispensation of Providence, and I'd be a poor-spirited
mouse to waste the chance. I think I'll
go with you&mdash;don't you?"</p>

<p class="figcenter"><a name="p06" id="p06"></a><a href="./images/p06.png"><img  src="./images/tp06.png" alt="&quot;Could he&mdash;couldn't he?&quot;" title="&quot;Could he&mdash;couldn't he?&quot;" /></a></p><p class="figcenter"><i>"Could he&mdash;couldn't he?"</i></p>

<p>Could he leave that prostrate form on the
truck and snatch at this bit of heaven dangling
<a name='Page_29' id='Page_29'><span class="pagenum">Page 29</span></a>before him? Could he&mdash;Couldn't he?
No, he could not. It would be a question of fifteen
minutes perhaps before the drowsy Billy
would be marching to the police station, and
in his entirely casual and fearless state of mind,
the big athlete would make history for some
policeman, his friend could not doubt, before
he got there. Rex had put his hand to this
intoxicated plow and he must not look back,
even when the prospect backwards was so
bewilderingly attractive, so tantalizingly easy.
He stammered badly when, at length, the
silence which followed the soft voice had to be
filled.</p>

<p>"I'm simply&mdash;simply&mdash;broken up, Miss
Margery," and the girl's eyes looked at him
with a sweet wideness that made it harder. "I
don't know how to tell you, and I don't know
how to resign myself to it either, but I&mdash;I can't
take you to the theater. I&mdash;I've got to&mdash;got
to&mdash;well, you see, I've got to be with Billy."</p>

<p>She spoke quickly at that. "Mr. Fairfax, is
Billy really ill&mdash;is there something more than
<a name='Page_30' id='Page_30'><span class="pagenum">Page 30</span></a>I understand? Why didn't you tell me? Has
their been an accident, perhaps? Why, I must
go to him too&mdash;come&mdash;hurry&mdash;I'll go with
you, of course."</p>

<p>Rex stumbled again in his effort to quiet her
alarm, to prevent this scheme of seeking Billy
on his couch of pain. "Oh no, indeed you mustn't
do that," he objected strenuously. "I couldn't
let you, you know. I don't want you to be bothered.
Billy isn't ill at all&mdash;there hasn't been
any accident, I give you my word. He's all
right&mdash;Billy's all right." He had quite lost his
prospective by now, and did not see the rocks
upon which he rushed.</p>

<p>"If Billy's all right, why isn't he here?"
demanded Billy's cousin severely.</p>

<p>Rex saw now. "He isn't exactly&mdash;that is to
say&mdash;all right, you know. You see how it is,"
and he gazed involuntarily at the sleeping giant
huddled on the truck.</p>

<p>"I do not see." The brown eyes had never
looked at him so coldly before, and their
expression cut him.</p>
<p><a name='Page_31' id='Page_31'><span class="pagenum">Page 31</span></a></p>
<p>"I'm glad you don't," he cried, and realized
that the words had taken him a step deeper
into trouble. "It's just this way, Miss Margery&mdash;Billy
isn't hurt or ill, but he isn't&mdash;isn't
feeling quite himself, and&mdash;and I've got to&mdash;I've
got to be with him." His voice sounded as
if he were going to cry, but it moved the girl to
no pity.</p>

<p>"Oh!" she said, and her bewildered tone
was a whole world removed from the bright
comradeship with which she had met him. "I
see&mdash;you and Billy have something else planned."
Her face flushed suddenly. "I'm sorry I
misunderstood about&mdash;about the theater. I
wouldn't for worlds have&mdash;have seemed to
force you to&mdash;" She stopped, embarrassed,
hurt, but yet with her graceful dignity
untouched.</p>

<p>"Oh," the wretched Rex exclaimed impetuously,
"if I could only take you to the theater,
I'd rather than&mdash;" but the girl stopped
him.</p>

<p>"Never mind about that, please," she said,
<a name='Page_32' id='Page_32'><span class="pagenum">Page 32</span></a>with gentle decision. "I must go home&mdash;when
is the next boat? One is going now&mdash;good-night,
Mr. Fairfax&mdash;no, don't come with
me&mdash;I don't need you," and she was gone.</p>

<p>Two minutes later Strong's innocent slumbers
were dispersed by a vicious shake. "Wake
up! wake up!" ordered Fairfax, restraining
himself with difficulty from mangling the cause
of his sufferings. "I've had enough, and we're
going home, straight."</p>

<p>Rex was mistaken about that, but Billy was
cordial in agreeing with him. "Good idea,
Recky! Howd'y' ever come to think of it? Le's
go home straight; tha's a bully good thing to do.
Le's do it. Big head on you, ol' boy," and yawning
still, but with unperturbed good nature,
Strong marched, a bit crookedly, arm in arm
with his friend to the street.</p>

<p class="figcenter"><a name="p07" id="p07"></a><a href="./images/p07.png"><img  src="./images/tp07.png" alt="At every station the conductor and Rex had to reason with him" title="At every station the conductor and Rex had to reason with him" /></a></p><p class="figcenter"><i>At every station the conductor and Rex had to reason with him</i></p>

<p>Rex's memory of the trip uptown on the
Elevated was like an evil dream. Strong, after
his nap, was as a giant refreshed, and his play
of wit knew no contracting limits. There were,
luckily, not many passengers going up at this
<a name='Page_33' id='Page_33'><span class="pagenum">Page 33</span></a>hour, but the dozen or so on the car were regaled.
Billy selected a seat on the floor with
his broad back planted against the door, and
at every station the conductor and Rex had to
reason with him at length before the door could
be opened. The official threatened as well as he
could for laughing to put him off, but he threatened
less strenuously for the sight of six feet
two of muscle in magnificently fit condition.
This lasted for half a dozen stations and then
the patient began to play like a mountainous
kitten. He took a strap on either side of the car
and turned somersaults; he did traveling ring
work with them; he gave a standing broad
jump that would have been creditable on an
athletic field; he had his audience screaming
with laughter at an imitation of water polo over
the back of a seat. Then, just as the fun was at
an almost impossible point, and the conductor,
highly entertained but worried, was considering
how to get this chap arrested, Billy walked
up to him with charming friendliness and
shook hands.</p>
<p><a name='Page_34' id='Page_34'><span class="pagenum">Page 34</span></a></p>
<p>"One th' besh track meets I've ever had
pleasure attendin', sir," he said genially, and
sat down and relapsed into grave dignity.</p>

<p>So he remained for five minutes, to the trembling
joy of his exhausted guardian, but it was
too good to be true. Suddenly, at Fifty-third
Street, he spied a young woman at the other end
of the car. There were not more than nine passengers,
so that each person might have had a
matter of half a dozen seats a piece, but
Strong suddenly felt a demand on his
politeness, and reason was nothing to him.
He rose and marched the forty feet or so
between himself and the woman, and, standing
in front of her, lifted, with some difficulty,
his hat.</p>

<p>"Won't you take my seat, madam?" he inquired,
with a smile of perfect courtesy.</p>

<p>The young person was a young person of
common-sense and she caught the situation.
She flashed a reassuring glance at Rex, hovering
distressed in the background, and shook
her head at Strong politely. "No&mdash;no, thank
<a name='Page_35' id='Page_35'><span class="pagenum">Page 35</span></a>you," she said; "I think I can find a seat at
this end that will do nicely."</p>

<p>"Madam, I insist," Strong addressed her
again earnestly.</p>

<p>"No, really," The young woman was embarrassed,
for the eyes of the car were on her.
"Thank you so much," she said finally; "I
think I'd better stay here."</p>

<p>Strong bent over and put a great hand lightly
on her arm. "Madam, as gen'leman I cannot,
cannot allow it. Madam, you mush take my
seat. Pleash, madam, do not make scene. 'S
pleasure to me, 'sure you&mdash;greates' pleasure,"
and beneath this courtly urgency the flushed
girl walked shamefacedly the length of the
almost empty car, and sat down in Strong's seat,
while that soul of chivalry put his hand through
a strap and so stood till his ministering angel
extracted him from the train at Seventy-second
Street.</p>

<p>With a sigh of heartfelt relief, Rex put his
arm in the big fellow's at the foot of the steps.
Freedom must now be at hand, for Billy's
<a name='Page_36' id='Page_36'><span class="pagenum">Page 36</span></a>home was in a great apartment building not ten
minutes' walk away. The culprit himself seemed
to realize that his fling was over.</p>

<p>"Raished Cain t'night, didn' we, ol' pal?"
he inquired, and squeezed Rex's guiding arm
with affection. "I'll shay this for you, Rex&mdash;you
may be soft-hearted ol' slob, you may be
half-witted donkey&mdash;I'm not denyin' all that
'n more, but I'll shay thish&mdash;you're the bes'
man to go on a drunk with in&mdash;in&mdash;in
The'logican Sem'nary. I'm not 'xceptin'
th'&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Shut up, Billy," remarked Rex, not for the
first time that night. "I'd get myself pulled together
a bit if I were you," he advised. "You're
going to see your family in a minute."</p>

<p>"M' poor fam'ly!" mourned Strong, shaking
his head. "M' poor fam'ly! Thish'll be
awful blow to m' fam'ly, Recky. They all like
so mush to see me sober&mdash;always&mdash;'s their
fad, Recky. Don't blame 'em, Recky, 's natural
to 'em. Some peop' born that way. M' poor
fam'ly."</p>
<p><a name='Page_37' id='Page_37'><span class="pagenum">Page 37</span></a></p>
<p>They stood in front of the broad driveway
which swept under lofty arches into the huge
apartment house. Strong stopped and gazed
upwards mournfully. "Right up there," he
murmured, pointing skywards&mdash;"M' fam'ly."
The tears were streaming down his face frankly
now. "I can't face 'em Recky, 'n this condition
you've got me in," he said more in sorrow than
in anger. At that second the last inspiration of
the evening caught him. Across the street arose
the mighty pile of an enormous uptown hotel.
Strong jerked his thumb over his shoulder.
"Go'n' break it to m' fam'ly by telegraph'
'em," he stated, and bitterly Rex repented of
that thoughtless mention of the Strongs to their
son and heir.</p>

<p>Good-naturedly as he had done everything,
but relentlessly, he dragged his victim over the
way, and direct to the Western Union office of
the hotel&mdash;"Webster's Union" he preferred
to call it. His first telegram read:</p>

<p>"Rex Fairfax got me drunk. Don't blame
him. It's natural to him."</p>
<p><a name='Page_38' id='Page_38'><span class="pagenum">Page 38</span></a></p>
<p>That one was confiscated, Strong complaining
gently that his friend was all "fads."</p>

<p>The second message was this:</p>

<p>"Dear Mama: Billy's intoxicated. Awfully
sorry. Couldn't be helped. Home soon."</p>

<p>That one went in spite of Fairfax's efforts,
with two cents extra to pay, which item was the
first event of the evening to ruffle Strong's temper.</p>

<p>"Shame, shame on rich cap'talists like Webster's
Union to wring two cents from poor drunk
chap, for lil' word like 'soon'," he growled,
and appealed to the operator. "Couldn't you
let me off that two cents?" he asked winningly.
"You're good fellow&mdash;good lookin' fellow
too"&mdash;which was the truth. "Well, then, can
I get 'em cheaper 'f I sen 'em by quantity? I'll
do that&mdash;how many for dollar, hey?"</p>

<p>"Five," said the grinning operator, troubled
by the irregularity, but taken by this highly
entertaining scheme of telegraphing across the
street. And Rex, his arts exhausted in vain,
watched hopelessly while, one after another,
<a name='Page_39' id='Page_39'><span class="pagenum">Page 39</span></a>five telegrams were sent to The Montana, a
hundred feet away. The first being short two
of the regulation ten words. Strong finished
with a cabalistic phrase: "Rectangular parallelopipedon."</p>

<p>"That'll get even Webster's Union for chargin'
me two cents for 'soon'," he chuckled.
"Don't y' wish y' hadn' charged me that two
cents, hey?" he demanded of the operator,
laughing joyfully and cocking his hat over one
ear, and the operator and two or three men who
stood near could do no otherwise than laugh
joyfully too. Strong straightened his face into a
semblance of deep gravity. "Thish next one's
important," he announced, and put the end of
the pencil in his mouth and meditated, while
his fascinated audience watched him. He was
lost in thought for perhaps two minutes, and
then scribbled madly, and as he ended the little
bunch of men crowded frankly to look at what
he had written. He pushed it toward them with
charming unreserve, and the bewilderment
with which it was read seemed to please him.</p>
<p><a name='Page_40' id='Page_40'><span class="pagenum">Page 40</span></a></p>
<p>"Dear Papa": it ran. "I'm Calymene Blumembachii,
a trilobite, one of the crustaceans
related to the emtomostracans, but looking
more like a tetradecapod, but always your
affectionate&mdash;Billy."</p>

<p>He pushed it to the operator. "Split that in
three," he ordered. "Don't want ruin the wires
I'm careful 'bout wires. Big fall snow wouldn't
do more damage 'n heavy words like that," he
explained to the listening circle. "Think I look
like tetradecapod?" he asked of them as
one who makes conversation. "Had that in
geology lesson when I was fifteen," he went on.
"Got lodged in crack in brain and there tish t'
thish day! Every now'n then I go 'flip,'"&mdash;he
appeared to pull a light lever situated in his
head&mdash;"'n fire it off. See? Always hit something."</p>

<p>It was ten o'clock when, the job lot of telegrams
despatched, Fairfax led his volcano
from the hotel and headed for the apartment
house. He expected another balk at the entrance,
for his round of gaiety had come now
<a name='Page_41' id='Page_41'><span class="pagenum">Page 41</span></a>to seem to him eternal&mdash;he could hardly imagine
a life in which he was not conducting a
tipsy man through a maze of experiences. So
that it was one of the surprises of the evening
when Strong entered quietly and with perfect
deportment took his place in the elevator and
got out again, eight floors up, with the mildness
of a dove. At the door of the apartment
came the last brief but sharp action of the
campaign.</p>

<p>"Recky," he said, taking Fairfax's shoulders
in his great grasp, "no mother could be
t' me what you've been."</p>

<p>"I hope not," Rex responded promptly, but
Strong was not to be side-tracked.</p>

<p>"No mother 'n the world&mdash;not one&mdash;no
sir!" he went on. His voice broke with feeling.
"I'll nev' forget it&mdash;nev'&mdash;don't ask me to,"
he insisted. "Dear Recky&mdash;blessed old tomfool&mdash;I'm
go'n kiss you good-night."</p>

<p>"You bet you're not," said Fairfax with emphasis.
"Let go of me, you idiot," and he tried
to loosen the hands on his shoulders.</p>
<p><a name='Page_42' id='Page_42'><span class="pagenum">Page 42</span></a></p>
<p>But one of the most powerful men in New
York had him in his grip, and Rex found himself
suddenly folded in Billy's arms, while a
chaste salute was planted full on his mouth. As
he emerged a second later, disgusted and furious,
from this tender embrace, the clang of the
elevator twenty feet away caught his ear and,
turning, his eyes met the astonished gaze of
two young girls and their scornful, frowning
father. At that moment the door of the Strongs'
apartment opened, there was a vision of the
elder Mr. Strong's distracted face, the yellow
gleam of the last telegram in his hands, and
Rex fled.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>Two weeks later, a May breeze rustling
through the greenness of the quadrangle, brushed
softly the ivy-clad brick walls, and stole,
like a runaway child to its playmate, through
an open window of the Theological Seminary
building at Chelsea Square. Entering so, it
flapped suddenly at the white curtains as if
astonished. What was this? Two muscular
<a name='Page_43' id='Page_43'><span class="pagenum">Page 43</span></a>black clad arms were stretched across a table,
and between them lay a brown head, inert,
hopeless. It seemed strange that on such a May
day, with such a May breeze, life could look
dark to anything young, yet Reginald Fairfax,
at the head of the graduating class, easily first
in more than one way&mdash;in scholarship, in athletics,
in versatility, and, more than all, like
George Washington, "first in the hearts of his
countrymen," the most popular man of the
Seminary&mdash;this successful and well beloved
young person sat wretched and restless in his
room and let the breeze blow over his prostrate
head and his idle, nerveless hands. Since the
night of the rescue of Billy Strong he had felt
himself another and a worse man. He sent a
note to his cousin the next day.</p>

<p>"Dear Carty," it read, "For mercy sake let
me alone. I know I've lost my chance at St.
Eric's and I know you'll say it was my own
fault. I don't want to hear either statement, so
don't come near me till I hunt you up, which I
will do when I'm fit to talk to a white man. I'm
<a name='Page_44' id='Page_44'><span class="pagenum">Page 44</span></a>grateful, though you may not believe it. Yours&mdash;Rex."</p>

<p>But the lost chance at St. Eric's, although it
was coming to weigh heavily on his buoyant
spirit, was not the worst of his troubles. The
girl from Orange&mdash;there lay the sting. He
had sent her a note as well, but there was little
he was free to say without betraying Billy,
the note was mostly vague expressions of regret,
and Rex knew her clearheaded directness too
well to hope that it would count for much. No
answer had come, and, day by day, he had
grown more dejected, hoping against hope for
one.</p>

<p>A knock&mdash;the postman's knock&mdash;and Rex
started and sprang to the door. One letter, but
he could hardly believe his glad eyes when he
saw the address on it, for it was the handwriting
which he had come to know well, had known
well, seeing it once&mdash;her handwriting. In a
moment the jagged-edged envelope, torn in a
desperate hurry to get what it held, lay one side,
and he was reading.</p>
<p><a name='Page_45' id='Page_45'><span class="pagenum">Page 45</span></a></p>
<p>"Dear Mr. Fairfax": the letter ran; "For
two weeks I have been very unjust to you and
I want to beg your pardon. Billy was here three
days ago, and what I didn't know and what he
didn't know we patched together, and the consequence
is I want to apologize and to make
up to you, if I can, for being so disagreeable.
Billy's recollections of that night were disjointed,
but he remembered a lot in spots, and I
know now just what a friend you were to him
and how you saved him. I think he was horrid,
but I think you were fine&mdash;simply fine. I can't
half say it in writing so will you please come
out for over Sunday&mdash;mother says&mdash;and I'll
try to show you how splendid I think you were.
Will you? Yours sincerely"&mdash;and her name.</p>

<p>Would he? Such a radiant smile shone
through the little bare room that the May
breeze, catching its light at the window, clapped
gay applause against the flapping curtain. This
was as it should be.</p>

<p>But the breeze and the postman were not to
be the only messengers of happiness. Steps
<a name='Page_46' id='Page_46'><span class="pagenum">Page 46</span></a>sounded down the long, empty hall, stopped at
his door, and Rex, a new joy of living pulsing
through him, sprang again, almost before the
knock sounded, to meet gladly what might be
coming. His face looked out of the wide-open
doorway with so bright a welcome to the world,
that the two men who stood across the threshold
smiled an involuntary answer.</p>

<p>"Carty! I'm awfully glad"&mdash;and Rex stopped
to put his hand out graciously, deferentially,
to the gray-haired and distinguished man
who stood with Carter Reed.</p>

<p>"Judge Rush, this is my cousin, Mr. Fairfax,"
Reed presented him, and in a moment
Rex's friend, the breeze, was helping hospitality
on with gay little refreshing dashes at a
warm, silvered head, as Judge Rush sat in the
biggest chair at the big open window. He beamed
upon the young man with interested, friendly
eyes.</p>

<p>"That's all very well about the quadrangle,
Mr. Reed. It certainly is beautiful and like the
English Universities," he broke into a sentence
<a name='Page_47' id='Page_47'><span class="pagenum">Page 47</span></a>genially. "But I wish to talk to Mr. Fairfax.
I've come to bring you the first news, Mr. Fairfax,
of what you will hear officially within a day
or two&mdash;that the vestry of St. Eric's hope you
will consider a call to be our assistant rector."
Rex's heart almost stopped beating, and his
smile faded as he stared breathless at this portly
and beneficent Mercury. Mercury went on
"A vestry meeting was held last night in which
this was decided upon. Your brilliant record
in this seminary and other qualifications which
have been mentioned to us by high authorities,
were the reasons for this action which appeared
upon the surface, but I want you to know the
inner workings&mdash;I asked your cousin to
bring me here that I might have the pleasure
of telling you."</p>

<p>It was rather warm, and the old gentleman
had climbed stairs, and his conversation had
been weighty and steady. He arrested its flow
for a moment and took a long breath. "Don't
stop," said Rex earnestly, and the others broke
into sudden laughter.</p>
<p><a name='Page_48' id='Page_48'><span class="pagenum">Page 48</span></a></p>
<p>"I like that," Judge Rush sputtered, chuckling.
"You're ready to let me kill myself, if
needs be, to get the facts. All right, young man&mdash;I
like impetuosity&mdash;it means energy. I'll
go on. The facts not known to the public,
which I wish to tell you, are as follows. After
your failure to keep your appointment on the
evening of the 7th, I was about through with
you. I considered you careless both of your own
interests and ours, and we began to look for
another assistant. A man who fitted the place
as you did seemed hard to find and the case was
<i>in statu quo</i> when, two nights ago, my son
brought home young William Strong to dinner.
Our families are old friends and Billy's father
and I were chums in college, so the boy is at
home in our house. As you probably know,
he has the gift of telling a good story, so when
he began on the events of an evening which you
will remember&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Rex's deep laughter broke into the dignified
sentences at this point.</p>

<p>"I see you remember." Judge Rush smiled
<a name='Page_49' id='Page_49'><span class="pagenum">Page 49</span></a>benignly. "Well, Mr. Fairfax, Billy made an
amusing story of that evening. Only the family
were at the table and he spared himself not at
all. He had been in Orange the day before, and
the young lady in the case had told him how
you had protected him at your own expense&mdash;he
made that funny too, but I thought it very
fine behavior&mdash;very fine, indeed, sir." Rex's
face flushed under this. "And as I thought the
whole affair over afterwards, I not only understood
why you had failed me, but I honored
you for attempting no explanation, and I made
up my mind that you were the man we wanted.
Yes, sir, the man we want. A man who knows
how to deal with the situations of to-day, with
the vices of a great city, that is what we want.
I consider tact, and broad-mindedness and
self-sacrifice no small qualities for a minister
of the gospel; and a combination of those qualities,
as in you, I consider exceptional. So I went
to this vestry meeting primed, and I told them
we had got to have you, sir&mdash;and we've got to.
You'll come?"</p>
<p><a name='Page_50' id='Page_50'><span class="pagenum">Page 50</span></a></p>
<p>The question was much like an order, but
Rex did not mind. "Indeed, I'll come, Judge
Rush," he said, and his manner of saying it
won the last doubtful bit of the Judge's heart.</p>

<p>The Sunday morning when the new assistant
preached his first sermon in St. Eric's, there
sat well back in the congregation a dark-eyed
girl, and with her a tall and powerful young
man, whose deep shoulders and movements, as
of a well fitted machine, advertised an athlete in
perfect form. The girl's face was rapt as she followed,
her soul in her eyes, the clean-cut, short
sermon, and when the congregation filtered
slowly down the aisles she said not a word. But as
the two turned into the street she spoke at last.</p>

<p>"He is a saint, isn't he, Billy?" she asked,
and drew a long breath of contentment.</p>

<p>And from six-feet-two in mid-air came Billy
Strong's dictum. "Margery," he said, impressively,
"Rex may be a parson and all that, but,
to my mind, that's not against him; to my mind
that suits his style of handling the gloves.
There was a chap in the Bible"&mdash;Billy swal<a name='Page_51' id='Page_51'><span class="pagenum">Page 51</span></a>lowed
as if embarrassed&mdash;"who&mdash;who was
the spit 'n' image of Rex&mdash;the good Samaritan
chap, you know. He found a seedy one falling
over himself by the wayside, and he called him
a beast and set him up, and took him to a
hotel or something and told the innkeeper
to charge it to him, and&mdash;I forget the exact
words, but he saw him through, don't you
know? And he did it all in a sporty sort of way
and there wasn't a word of whining or fussing
at him because he was loaded&mdash;that was awfully
white of the chap. Rex did more than that
for me and not a syllable has he peeped since.
And, you know, the consequence of that masterly
silence is that I've gone on the water-wagon&mdash;yes,
sir&mdash;for a year. And I'm hanged
if I'm not going to church every Sunday. He
may be a saint as you say, and I suppose there's
no doubt but he's horrid intellectual&mdash;every
man must have his weaknesses. But the man
that's a good Samaritan and a good sport all in
one, he's my sort, I'm for him," said Billy Strong.</p>

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread

collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project

Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/pglaf

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
compressed (zipped), HTML and others.

Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.
VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org">http://www.gutenberg.org</a>

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,
are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to
download any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular
search system you may utilize the following addresses and just
download by the etext year.

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext06/">http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext06/</a>

    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,
     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)

EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are
filed in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part
of the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is
identical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single
digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For
example an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:

http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/1/0/2/3/10234

or filename 24689 would be found at:
http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/2/4/6/8/24689
